# Moviebook

This is a mobile application built using React-native for the movie community. Users can share reviews/quotes/captions of their favourite movies/tv-series while also following their friends and liking and commenting on the movies they are watching. There were a lot of features I wanted to add and go to market with... However, there already is a great application in the app store that does exactly this. Thus, I decided to call it a day and move to a different project. Feel free to play around with this project and experiment if you're new to react-native like I am :)

PS: There are some unfunctional buttons like 'settings' that aren't coded yet. I had learnt what I had to with the project and decided to move forward with a different project.
